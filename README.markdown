# Nadine

This is the Django web project which runs behinds the scenes of coworking spaces.

Most of the action is in the staff application, where you'll find a member tracking and billing system.

## Requirements

* Python (Probably comes with your system otherwise it can be downloaded from their [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).)
* Virtualenv (install with `pip virtualenv`)
* XCode if you are on Mac OS X 
* Postgresql
* Does not play nice with SQLite

## Handy Installation Instructions

Install the required systems

	apt-get install postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all python-pip python-dev libffi-dev git

Install virtualenv using python pip to work on a sandbox

	pip install virtualenv

Create a virtual environment for the python project

	virtualenv nadine
	cd nadine
	source bin/activate
	
Dowload the nadine source code from github

	git clone https://github.com/nadineproject/nadine.git
	cd nadine

Configure the local settings for your environment

	cp nadine/local_settings.example nadine/local_settings.py
	vi nadine/local_settings.py

Create a blank database and grant all permissions to whatever account/password combination you want to use.

	psql -c "create database nadinedb"

Install all the requirments 

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Django's migrate command and create a superuser.  

	./manage.py migrate
	./manage.py createsuperuser

At this point you can run the server

	./manage.py runserver
	Visit your installation of Nadine at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

You will need to edit the django_sites database in the admin site unless your site is at example.com.

### Running the scheduler

In order to repeatedly execute tasks like checking and sending email, run this command:

    ./manage.py celeryd -B

You will need to run that command as a long lived process.  On linux and other unices, use something like the nohup command.

# Interlink (mailing lists) notes:

In the interest of shipping more quickly, we have made certain assumptions about the interlink mailing lists which may or may not suit everyone's needs.

- the reply-to address for mail from a list is the original sender, not the entire list
- attachments are neither saved nor sent to the list, but a removal note is appended to the message
- incoming messages are parsed for a single text message and a single html message (not multiple MIME messages)
- you can set the frequency of mail fetching by changing the value in CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE in your settings.py or local_settings.py
- loops and bounces are silently dropped
- any email sent to a list which is not in a subscriber's user or membership record is moderated
- the sender of a message receives a copy of the message like any other subscriber
